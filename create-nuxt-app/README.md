# Deploying a Statically Generated Nuxt.js app with Now .

> 

### Deploy with Now

First we need to create a `now.json` configuration file to instruct Now how to build the project.

For this example we will be using our newest version [Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

By adding the `version` key to the `now.json` file, we can specify which Now Platform version to use.

We also need to define each builders we would like to use. [Builders](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) are modules that take a deployment's source and return an output, consisting of [either static files or dynamic Lambdas](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs).

In this case we are going to use `@now/static-build` to build and deploy our Nuxt application selecting the `package.json` as our entry point. We will also define a name for our project (optional).

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-nuxt-project",
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/static-build" }
  ]
}
``` 

We also need to include a script in `package.json` named `"now-build"` that specifies what command Now will run on the server to "build" your application. Also notice that we are using `npm run build` that will create a folder called `dist` which Now identifies as the static folder.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
      ...
      "build": "nuxt build",
      "now-build": "nuxt build --spa"
    },
}
```

We are now ready to deploy the app.

```
now
```
